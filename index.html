                <p class="first">I handcraft stellar, brand true websites for creative entrepreneurs seeking to be their best, unique selves.</p>

                <p>I’m a multi-talented web developer with a passion for design. I earned a Bachelor’s degree from Full Sail University in computer science, and I’m working on a Master’s degree in business.</p>

                <p>I have an extensive background in publishing and entertainment. I've worked tirelessly to improve my skillset to include digital marketing and desktop/digital publishing. I've utilized that skillset to triple sales for my clients and rebrand their companies in a way that appealed to a wider audience. I pride myself on avoiding using political and socio-economic issues to pander to the public. I give people good, honest work without temporary patches.</p>
                
                <p>While I have a true passion for what I do, I enjoy utilizing my skillset to give back to my community. I've run two nonprofit organizations and spearheaded programs for two humanitarian groups. I've overhauled public relations, organized community events, and taught classes.</p>

                <p>I owN and operate a small business called Jubiki Studios. Check it out: http://www.jubiki.com</p>
