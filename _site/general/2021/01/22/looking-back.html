                        <p>Last night, I saw a photo on Facebook with a quote, “I know everything happens for a reason, but what the fuck?!” Nothing described 2020 better than that, if you ask me. Was there anyone that didn’t do something in excess for that year?</p>

<p>According to the American Heart Association, alcohol sales were up 54%. I know quite a few people that helped keep that number up. As trapped extroverts, I understood that prolonged time alone was taxing for them. Personally speaking, I found it refreshing.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>There were things that I missed, even as introverted as I am. I wanted to eat at a restaurant and go to a movie. I wanted to socialize my baby (who had been born the previous year). I wanted to stop wearing a mask.</p>

<p>I have thalassemia, and I was on the high risk list. That didn’t leave me with much to do, honestly. I went back to college, but I couldn’t tell you when I started that. I struggled with my own mental health (non-quarantine related) and a host of other problems.</p>

<p>On top of it all, I was struggling to keep my business open.</p>

<p>Remember when I said everyone did something in excess? Well, I exited 2020 pregnant with a second baby. Jonathan, my husband, and I wanted another baby, but I hadn’t planned on it happening so quickly.</p>

<p>So, I came into 2021 pregnant, miserable, and looking for better things. I was happy that we were installing a new administration. I had a new, good paying job. I’ll be wrapping up my master’s degree.</p>

<p>I need a good year of positive progress. I understand that 2020 was hard on everyone, but I’m coming out of a 4-year hell haul.</p>
