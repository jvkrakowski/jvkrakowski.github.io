                <p class="excerpt"><p>Last night, I saw a photo on Facebook with a quote, “I know everything happens for a reason, but what the fuck?!” Nothing described 2020 better than that, if you ask me. Was there anyone that didn’t do something in excess for that year?</p>

<p>According to the American Heart Association, alcohol sales were up 54%. I know quite a few people that helped keep that number up. As trapped extroverts, I understood that prolonged time alone was taxing for them. Personally speaking, I found it refreshing.</p>

<p>There were things that I missed, even as introverted as I am. I wanted to eat at a restaurant and go to a movie. I wanted to socialize my baby (who had been born the previous year). I wanted to stop wearing a mask.</p>

<p>I have thalassemia, and I was on the high risk list. That didn’t leave me with much to do, honestly. I went back to college, but I couldn’t tell you when I started that. I struggled with my own mental health (non-quarantine related) and a host of other problems.</p>

<p>On top of it all, I was struggling to keep my business open.</p>

<p>Remember when I said everyone did something in excess? Well, I exited 2020 pregnant with a second baby. Jonathan, my husband, and I wanted another baby, but I hadn’t planned on it happening so quickly.</p>

<p>So, I came into 2021 pregnant, miserable, and looking for better things. I was happy that we were installing a new administration. I had a new, good paying job. I’ll be wrapping up my master’s degree.</p>

<p>I need a good year of positive progress. I understand that 2020 was hard on everyone, but I’m coming out of a 4-year hell haul.</p>

<!--                <img src="">-->
                <p class="excerpt"><p>Everyone needs a mascot, so I created a cute panda that I intend to plaster on merchandise that I’ll be selling. The designs are originals of mine, and I’m very proud of them. I’ll have an entire line of my (currently unnamed) panda in various scenes. This was at the suggestion of close friends and family that saw me doodling the character a few months back.</p>

<p>I have yet to name my panda or choose a real gender, but those will be coming soon.</p>

                <p class="excerpt"><p>Everyone likes knowing what happens behind the curtains. Knowing you’re in on a secret is an enticing feeling that most people take at first opportunity. It’s a sense of adventure that makes behind-the-scenes content interesting. I thought a little behind-the-scenes action would be a breath of fresh are for everyone.</p>

<p>There are two types of people reading that first line: I need to work for them or I’ve got them hooked. Unknown to many, that’s the dividing line between success and failure.</p>
