                        <p>I’m a multi-talented professional with a passion for design and coding. I earned a Bachelor’s degree from Full Sail University in full stack web development. Currently, I’m working on a Master’s degree with the intent to earn a doctorate.</p>
                        
                        <p>I have an extensive background in publishing and entertainment. My true passion, though, is nonprofit organizations and outreach programs. I enjoy giving back to the community using my skillset. I’ve run two nonprofit organizations I was vital to overhauling their public relations and upgrading their tech. I’ve organized community events, and I’m working on plans for a tiny home village for veterans.</p>
