After a decade of evaluating websites, does anyone blame me? When you imagine creating websites, endless scrolling isn’t something you think will be a problem. I learned to appreciate those “back to top” buttons if nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I acknowledge on a minor level that long content is sometimes unavoidable. Most help sections are among those exceptions. In those cases, there’s such a thing as an accordion effect to help condense content into a consumable format. Today, we’re going to learn how to build a simple one with jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-jquery-vs-javascript&quot;&gt;Using JQuery vs. Javascript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we want to add interaction to a website, we use frameworks and libraries to add effects that appeal to visitors. Many people have come to expect it as a standard practice. For example, we automatically know to expand menus when we see a downward arrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most interactive elements are built with jquery as a standard practice. Not only is it simpler to code, but it also saves on lines of code. However, that doesn’t mean that javascript isn’t worth learning before touching jquery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javascript is the programming language many frameworks were built on. As I’ve told many new developers, “Learn the basic languages first, and then you can learn the frameworks with ease.” When you know javascript, learning jquery is like riding a bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I encourage everyone to learn javascript, jquery has an elegance to it that javascript lacks. It helps us simplify everyday web tasks. Many people find it easier to understand than javascript, which is why we’re starting with it today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;before-we-start&quot;&gt;Before We Start&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we were coding for an actual project, our first task would be determining whether we needed this effect. While it’s a nice touch, too many effects are a distraction. Finding the right balance is key to good design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right balance depends on your client’s audience. The only way to discover what they like is through research. Remember that when you’re working on your next project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-tools&quot;&gt;Our Tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tools you’ll be needing are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;jQuery 3.5.1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Code Editor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dummy content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, choosing a code editor is a personal matter. Everyone has their preference for one reason or another. However, as a newbie, I recommend selecting a basic, stripped-down code editor that won’t help you along. It encourages you to learn the code rather than depend on a program to tell you what could come next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re using Windows, I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://notepad-plus-plus.org/&quot;&gt;Notepad++&lt;/a&gt; as a code editor. For everyone else, you can check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; with autocomplete disabled. If you have any suggestions for code editors, comment below and let us know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many resources to create or download dummy content. Since we need a few sentences, though, I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lipsum.com/&quot;&gt;Lipsum&lt;/a&gt;, a generator that gives paragraphs of nonsense Latin as a placeholder for projects. Make sure to bookmark that site because you might find yourself using it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-it-up&quot;&gt;Setting it Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set up your work environment, we’re going to create a folder on your desktop. You can name it anything you want, but it would be best to keep it simple. We’re going to save all our files to that folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to open the folder and then minimize it on my taskbar. It’s a personal preference, so you can do whatever you want at this point. Just don’t forget to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jquery.com/&quot;&gt;download jquery&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also an option to use a CDN, which will give you a direct link that will work just as well. The acronym &lt;strong&gt;CDN&lt;/strong&gt; stands for &lt;em&gt;Content Delivery Network&lt;/em&gt;. It makes it easier for projects like jquery to deliver content to users without the need to download the files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You register for your CDN link and then copy and paste the link into the head section of your web page. Be warned, though; you’ll need an internet connection to make your jquery work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic-csshtml&quot;&gt;Basic CSS/HTML&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, we’re going to open our code editor to create the HTML that will display the jQuery code we make. Since this isn’t a tutorial on how to code HTML, I’ll slap the code right here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-HTML&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;normalize.css&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;script src=&quot;https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js&quot; integrity=&quot;sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;script src=&quot;ask.js&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;Free Web tutorials&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta name=&quot;keywords&quot; content=&quot;HTML,CSS,XML,JavaScript&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta name=&quot;author&quot; content=&quot;John Doe&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Ask | Built with JQuery&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Ask &amp;amp;mdash; Demo&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A basic, no frills FAQ built with jquery.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;input class=&quot;open&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;Open All&quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;dl class=&quot;questions&quot;&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;dt&amp;gt;Question 1&amp;lt;/dt&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;dd&amp;gt;Answer&amp;lt;/dd&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;dt&amp;gt;Question 2&amp;lt;/dt&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;dd&amp;gt;Answer.&amp;lt;/dd&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/dl&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the head section, you’ll notice several essential bits of code. The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;link /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; code tells the browser where to find the stylesheets. There are two stylesheets, but you don’t need the second one. Normalize is a stylesheet that unifies how browsers display web elements. While useful, it’s not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The **&lt;script&gt;** code tells the browser where to find the jquery. There are two sets of **&lt;script&gt;** code; one for the main jQuery and another for our bit of code. Make sure to have both!&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;dl&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; element defines a description list. That is the web element we’re going to call in our jquery file. Please give it a bit of content; otherwise, you won’t see a change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, we’re not learning to code HTML. Copy and paste the code into your index file. Speaking of which, you need to create an index file and save it to your folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-jquery&quot;&gt;The JQuery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we’re going to concentrate on creating the script that will make this accordion work. Here is the full code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jquery&quot;&gt;$(function () {
  var Speed = 800;
  $('.questions dd').hide();
  $('.questions dt').click(function () {
    $(this).next(&quot;.questions dd&quot;).slideToggle(Speed);
    $(this).toggleClass(&quot;expanded_img&quot;);
  });
    $('.open').click(function (){
        $('.questions dd').slideToggle('.questions dt');
        $('.questions dt').toggleClass(&quot;expanded_img&quot;);
        $('.open').val('Open All');
        $('.open').toggleClass('close');
        $('.close').val('Close All').removeClass('.close');
    });
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above code is simple, and I purposefully made it that way. if you look at the first line of code, you’re going to see this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jquery&quot;&gt;$(function() { ... });
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That code is the short-hand for the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jquery&quot;&gt;$(document).ready(function() { ... });

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of them ensure that the script is loaded once the DOM elements are ready to be used. The phrase “DOM elements” refers to the HTML on a web page. We need it to operate that way because the script won’t work correctly if the DOM elements aren’t loaded properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next bit of code looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jquery&quot;&gt;var Speed = 800;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that line, I’m declaring a variable called “Speed.” It will tell the script how quickly the accordion should open and close. We could place the number directly into the code, but I prefer the variable route. It’s personal preference, so go with what you feel comfortable doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we’ve come to the code that will make our accordion work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jquery&quot;&gt;$('.questions dd').hide();
  $('.questions dt').click(function () {
    $(this).next(&quot;.questions dd&quot;).slideToggle(Speed);
    $(this).toggleClass(&quot;expanded_img&quot;);
  });
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re telling the script to find the class “questions” and hide the answer portion of it. The following code makes the question a clickable link so that it will reveal the answer below it. The last bit of code appends the class “expanded_img” to the DIV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The class appended to the DIV is controlled by our stylesheet. It calls the icons that indicate the closed or open status of an accordion item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oscar Otero created a jquery cheat sheet that I feel is useful. I’ve used it many times over the years, and I recommend it. It will tell you more about the bits of code we’re using for our accordion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next portion of our code looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jquery&quot;&gt;$('.open').click(function (){
        $('.questions dd').slideToggle('.questions dt');
        $('.questions dt').toggleClass(&quot;expanded_img&quot;);
        $('.open').val('Open All');
        $('.open').toggleClass('close');
        $('.close').val('Close All').removeClass('.close');
    });
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was coding the accordion, I wanted an open and close icon next to the questions. The above code makes that happen repeatedly. The code that calls the “open” class is referring to the “Open All” button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The button will say “Open All” if the accordion is closed. Once you click the button, the text becomes “Close All.” The code doesn’t interfere with the click function of the question itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code [val] refers to the text of the button itself. Changing the value of that code will change the text that appears on the button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-css&quot;&gt;The CSS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, all of this is going to look strange until we add something to our stylesheet. If you refer back a few paragraphs, you’ll notice that I linked to a stylesheet called “normalize.” That is the work of a person named Nicolas Gallagher. You can check out his Github &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/necolas/normalize.css&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn’t necessary to add the normalize stylesheet. The only thing it does is unify how different browsers display the code. I like adding it to all my projects as a good habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stylesheet that I coded looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;16px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Helvetica&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Arial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#ecf0f1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.wrapper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;75%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;max-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1140px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin-left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin-right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;/* Quetions */&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;dl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.questions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#DCE3E5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;dl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.questions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#E8ECEE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;url('plus.svg')&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;no-repeat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;22px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background-origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;content-box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;15px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;border-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#DCE3E5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;dl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.questions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;dd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;15px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#DCE3E5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;dl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.questions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.expanded_img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#E8ECEE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;url('minus.svg')&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;no-repeat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;15px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background-origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;content-box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stylesheet adds aesthetics to the web page. It’s essentially personal preference, and it has little to do with jQuery itself. Altering the code here changes the way it appears on the web page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classes with icon backgrounds are essential. That is how jQuery changes the icon from one to another.  However, it can be tweaked to fit your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;have-some-fun&quot;&gt;Have Some Fun&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to experiment with the code. Playing around with someone else’s code is how many developers learned how to do it themselves. When you handle the code, you’re learning what each section does. You can download this code on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jvkrakowski/Ask&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Everything from font and format to site design and layout will affect their decision. However, nothing makes readers click away faster than ill-written content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grammatical errors in any form are a turnoff, making the content writer seem less of an expert. Well-written content ensures that someone is intelligent. There are rough drafts and edits for a reason. Every content writer is encouraged to take that process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revisit content after a year and ask, “How can this be improved?” That is a healthy, professional attitude for content writers. It is also suitable for content rankings. It renews interest in the content and gives people reason to return to a blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-tools-are-important&quot;&gt;Writing Tools are Important&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing Content for Better Reading was rewritten after a decade online. The original system that ranked it as quality content has changed. The readers presented with the content have changed. More writing tools are available to content writers, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing wrong with that, either. Writing tools exist to make writing quality content easier. Using them to critique and modify content is a good practice. It helps keep content readable, grammatically correct, and SEO compliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all content is public-worthy after a decade, though, but that judgment is up to the content writer to make. Make sure content is worth reading, and then take it through the writing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;content-is-the-1-priority&quot;&gt;Content is the #1 priority&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People visit and revisit websites for content. It conveys information and guides a person through their online experience. Think of it as a website’s persuasive edge. Good, well-written content will persuade people to transition from visitor to customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The content is an integral way people connect with a company online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;avoiding-skip-around&quot;&gt;Avoiding Skip Around&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A skip around is flitting from one place to another without comprehending anything. There is no real engagement, and people only nitpick what they need. These people are unlikely to visit again or find value in the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engagement is what companies need to rank and persuade. The more engagement occurs, the more valuable the content is. Here are a few tips to avoid skip around:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keep-it-short-and-direct&quot;&gt;Keep it short and direct.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write like the audience is in third grade. Keep content direct, and break everything into small, digestible portions. Avoid paginating content because only clickbait does that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus the content by cutting out unnecessary details. Concentrate only on essential points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of it like this: Someone needs a tutorial about creating a menu with jQuery. Does that person care about the history of jQuery? Does it matter why jQuery was chosen instead of plain CSS?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody cares about those details. Cut them out and continue writing what is important. Here are some other tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-bullet-headings&quot;&gt;Use bullet headings.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Break up significant content with bullet headings. Each heading should highlight an important point. Much like this post is doing. Content is more readable that way. It helps people comprehend it better, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lists-are-great&quot;&gt;Lists are great.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lists are like bullet headings; it is a fantastic way to relay large amounts of data in short bursts. Buzzfeed is known for viral blog posts like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;infographics-help-people-keep-information&quot;&gt;Infographics help people keep information.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infographics are beneficial visual aids. These images are attractive and condense information into a sharable format. It is effortless to share to Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;highlight-important-information&quot;&gt;Highlight important information.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If information needs to stand out, then highlight it someway. Using a different color — or bolding it out — makes it easier for people to see it. People pay attention to words or items on a page that seem visually different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-not-paginate-a-blog-post&quot;&gt;Do not paginate a blog post.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This point is so crucial that we reiterated it. Paginating content is annoying. Most importantly, it is counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reader will skim headlines or visit the comment section to avoid reading the content. That is not encouraging engagement or comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existence of a feature does not mean that we need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;focus-on-a-topic-not-a-subject&quot;&gt;Focus on a topic, not a subject.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focused content is easy to digest, attractive, and reader-friendly. Writing focused content is like writing a recipe versus an entire cookbook. Some algorithms reward longer content, but readers may not. That does not mean it should be full of worthless details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;readers-vs-search-engines&quot;&gt;Readers vs. Search Engines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, search engines have changed how people write. If better traffic is the goal, the content has to meet specific criteria. Content that meets criteria receives more attention by receiving a higher rank. It weeds out poorly written content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search Engine Optimization (SEO) helps people gain better rankings. Unfortunately, that does not guarantee their content is well written or even current. A good rank means it met the criteria, not that a content writer is fantastic. The writing process helps with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing is only part of the work, however. After publishing, the next step is promoting that content across social media. That is a new type of writing designed to hook a visitor in a few short sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing for social media has become a challenge all its own. Different platforms have different criteria to rank and deliver content. Understanding how their algorithms work is key to attracting readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting to visitors through writing is an essential part of business online. Good writing is easy to understand, appealing, and easy to access. While it is more work for content writers, the rewards can be lucrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a formula for content writing that works for their readers. What works for one content writer may not work for another. Doing a bit of research about readers will help form one.&lt;/p&gt;

It is that feeling of being in the know that’s too enticing for most people to bypass. It gives most people a sense of adventure that makes behind-the-scenes content interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of adventure, let us take a tour of this website. The stack used to build it was HTML/CSS/jQuery and Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-jekyll&quot;&gt;What is Jekyll?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby by Thomas Preston-Werner. Initially released in 2008, it is an open-source framework popular for an easy learning curve, blog-aware feature, and free hosting options with Github Pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is beginner-friendly with a setup and launch process that takes seconds. Its blog-aware features have made it popular for personal websites and portfolios. Best of all, its SEO friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-am-i-using-jekyll&quot;&gt;Why am I using Jekyll?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building dynamic, static sites have become popular since Jekyll’s release 13 years ago. These development options are quick to deliver content, offer flexibility, and perform better than some CMS alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, some SSGs perform better than Jekyll. While Jekyll is simple to learn, the compilation times can be rather long, and the support community is small compared to other options. If you are building something more extensive than a small blog, Jekyll will not perform as well as other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Jekyll is easily accessible via mobile phone through the Github app. It has a straightforward directory structure and a simple templating system. Handing it off would be easy, as it is not complicated to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;doing-more-with-jekyll&quot;&gt;Doing More with Jekyll.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is a versatile option to replace traditional CMS. While an SSG lacks a server-side, it is possible to make API calls, add e-commerce, and implement a search feature. With a bit of skill, it is all that is need to run a good website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example is this website. Built with Jekyll and jQuery, there is the option to add comments, pull data from third-party sources, and add a small shop. Using a static site generator does not mean giving up the features that make some CMS popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;showing-off-and-showing-up&quot;&gt;Showing Off and Showing Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This website is a career-building project in a master’s degree program. We were required to show our professionalism, leadership skills, and skillset. Per the assignment details, we could have used WordPress or Wix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a web developer, I thought creating mine from scratch would be a better option. Of course, it was approved without restrictions. As long as I met the other requirements, whatever I chose was fine with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something to know about me: I am slow to change. I become attached to certain stacks, and I like sticking with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building with Jekyll does show off some skill, but not anything impressive. I have my knowledge and skills listed, but nothing that shows proof of them. While you can visit me on Github, I don’t have much up there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I began coding, I kept everything on hardrives and USBs. I knew about services like Github, but I chose not to use them. Back then, I coded as a hobby. Besides that, I was deeply shy about my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like my art, I kept my files away from critiquing eyes. I gained a little confidence with my first paid contract, but, by that time, local storage was a habit of mine. I became attached to hording it myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I was working on a PC that was running Windows Vista. One day, it crashed due to a virus and I lost everything. It didn’t phase me, though, because I was in med school at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t need it for a portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I left med school to pursue code, I picked up jobs through referrals and networking. Nobody asked for a portfolio, so I was lazy about developing one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years later, and here I am with an empty portfolio but a full nursery. Between two boys under five and Non-Disclosure Agreements, I found it hard to build a portfolio. I thought quarantine was my moment to shine, but I ended up chasing a screaming crawler most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I showed up with the determination to get something done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;still-under-development&quot;&gt;Still Under Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I graduated with a master’s degree in business two months ago. I have no academic need for this website, but I felt it would be good to keep it around. I’ve been working on passion projects to fatten it up while I apply for jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be adding comments, a subscription form, and a small shop populated by Google API.
