            <dt>What do you look for in a company?</dt>
            <dd>I enjoy working for companies that are employee focused. When you take care of your employees, they take care of your clients. Companies that understand that are top quality in my eyes.</dd>
            <dt>What are your strengths?</dt>
            <dd>I have a true passion for what I do, and I'm devoted to continuously improving myself.</dd>
            <dt>What are your weaknesses?</dt>
            <dd>I like to take pride in what I do, and I want it to be perfect. It makes me incredibly shy about showing my work to others. I have a true passion for it, though, so I've been known to work on client projects till I crash.</dd>
            <dt>What is your working style?</dt>
            <dd>I work comfortably in a team setting, but I have no problems working on my own. I like both settings, and I value what both offers.</dd>
            <dt>Are you familiar with Waterfall/Agile/Scrum/etc project management style?</dt>
            <dd>Yes, I'm familiar with them, and I've worked in a team setitng with them in the past.</dd>
            <dt>What is your Myers-Brigg personality type?</dt>
            <dd>I'm an INFP.</dd>
            <dt>What are your coping strategies for working remotely?</dt>
            <dd>I make myself comfortable in a secluded area with snacks and drinks. I make sure to take my breaks, and I double check my work. I set short-term goals for myself, and I make sure I reach them.</dd>
