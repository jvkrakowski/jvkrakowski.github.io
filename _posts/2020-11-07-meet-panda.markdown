Everyone needs a mascot, so I created a cute panda that I intend to plaster on merchandise that I'll be selling. The designs are originals of mine, and I'm very proud of them. I'll have an entire line of my (currently unnamed) panda in various scenes. This was at the suggestion of close friends and family that saw me doodling the character a few months back.

I have yet to name my panda or choose a real gender, but those will be coming soon.

I designed the panda for merchandise to sell from my website. The website isn't available right now, but it should be up soon. I'm hoping people will like it. I'm writing tutorials to accompany the simple repositories on Github, and I wanted to feature my panda to narrate it. It will showcase my diverse, unique skillset.
